##  Overview

Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is highly sensitive to artefacts caused by acquisition errors, motion, and processing issues.  
This project introduces a semi-automated quality control pipeline that uses **normative modelling** to detect artefacts and processing failures based on individual-level white matter imaging features.

By leveraging normative modelling on a large population dataset (UK Biobank), we provide a robust and interpretable tool for identifying problematic dMRI data—improving downstream reliability and reducing manual QC workload.
