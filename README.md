# diffusion_nm
This directory contains the code for diffusion data pre-procesing and normative modelling (UK Biobank).<br>
The scripts used for the purpose of dMRI QC are available, althoigh still not properly ordered.<br>
I am currently in the process of cleaning up each script, making sure it runs smoothly for anybody who wants to use it. <br>
The preprint is available on biorxiv: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.30.546837v1.full
